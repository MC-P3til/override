Q: I put my microsoft account in and it doesn't work!

A: Make sure you do it on 'GUEST' wifi and use a
microsoft account that HAS minecraft Java bought and
setup! If it isn't setup go to 'https://minecraft.net'
but on your own time.

Q: Java.. it isn't working!

A: You can find Java in the folder with your instances
of minecraft! So go in prism launcher and go to settings
where you can find Java and click 'Browse' it should bring
to a file explorer where you should see java so click
Java > idk-21.0.9+10 > Contents > Home > bin > java

Q: It is saying it isn't verified by a proper developer

A: If it is saying this, there is a quick fix! All you
need to do is open the folder called 'Trouble Verifying?'
and you need to drag 'drag this.sh' into 'into this.app'
Very convenient names!
